## Job Simulation on Forage - July 2024

### Overview
Completed a job simulation for Tata Consultancy Services focused on creating data visualizations. The key tasks involved preparing questions for client senior leadership, creating visuals for data analysis, and presenting findings to improve decision-making processes.

### TASK-1: Questions for the CEO and CMO

#### Questions for the CEO:
1. **Revenue Trends:** 
   - How has the overall revenue trended over the past year? Are there any noticeable peaks or troughs that correlate with specific events or seasons?
   
2. **Customer Segmentation:**
   - Which customer segments (based on demographics like country, purchase frequency, and average spend) are contributing the most to our revenue?
   
3. **Product Performance:**
   - Which products have been the top performers in terms of revenue and quantity sold? Are there any products that are underperforming?
   
4. **Return Rate:**
   - What is the rate of product returns, and how does it impact our overall revenue? Are certain products or customer segments more prone to returns?

#### Questions for the CMO:
1. **Marketing Campaign Effectiveness:**
   - How effective have our marketing campaigns been in driving sales? Can we see a clear increase in revenue or customer engagement during campaign periods?
   
2. **Customer Acquisition Costs:**
   - What is the cost of acquiring new customers compared to the revenue they generate? Are there specific channels that are more cost-effective?
   
3. **Customer Retention:**
   - What is the retention rate of our customers, and what strategies can we implement to improve it? Are loyal customers contributing significantly to our revenue?
   
4. **Demographic Insights:**
   - How do different demographics respond to our marketing efforts? Are there specific age groups, genders, or locations that show higher engagement or conversion rates?

### TASK-2: Identifying Effective Visuals
To convey data and insights effectively, it is crucial to choose the appropriate visual representation. For this simulation, the following visual methods were identified:
- **Bar Graphs:** To show comparisons between different categories such as product performance and revenue trends.
- **Donut Charts:** To illustrate proportional data such as customer segmentation.
- **Slicers:** To allow for easy filtering and interactive data exploration.

### TASK-3: Creating Visuals Based on Leadership Requests
Created various data visualizations as per the questions requested by the CEO and CMO:

1. **Time Series Revenue Data (2011):**
   - A line graph displaying monthly revenue trends for 2011 to help the CEO analyze seasonal patterns and forecast future trends.
   
2. **Top 10 Revenue-Generating Countries (Excluding UK):**
   - A bar graph illustrating the top 10 countries by revenue and quantity sold, excluding the United Kingdom, to assist the CMO in understanding geographic performance.
   
3. **Top 10 Customers by Revenue:**
   - A descending bar graph showing the highest revenue-generating customers to the lowest, enabling the CMO to target key customers for retention strategies.
   
4. **Regional Product Demand:**
   - A comprehensive visual map displaying demand across all countries (excluding the UK) to help the CEO identify potential expansion areas.

### TASK-4: Video Presentation
Recorded a video presentation summarizing the findings and visualizations for the CEO and CMO. This exercise enhanced my presentation skills and ability to communicate complex data insights effectively.
